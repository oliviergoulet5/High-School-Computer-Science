# High School CompSci
Projects that I've worked on from 2015-17. Do not expect these to be good. I was fairly new to programming during this period of time. Some of the programs are just me trying to figure out simple things such as loops and classes. Some programs make absolutely no sense at all, some are just ridiculous and some I'm proud of. 

# Recommendation
I'd recommend checking out my flash games under Grade 11. These have been the projects that I've had the most fun working on and I believe I was most successful in. Especially the culminating activity where I made a Zelda-knock off game. You can find online flash players to run these files.
